## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rs-toolkit.git
   cd rs-toolkit
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install GDAL** (required for rasterio and geopandas):
   - **Ubuntu**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install gdal-bin python3-gdal
     ```
   - **Windows**: Use pre-built binaries from [GDAL](https://gdal.org/download.html) or `conda`.
   - **MacOS**:
     ```bash
     brew install gdal
     ```

5. **Run Jupyter notebooks**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
